			<p>Hi, my name is Julie and I am the simple veganista. I began a vegan lifestyle in the early part of 2011 and haven’t looked back. Since then I’ve become passionate about creating healthy vegan dishes, some 100% raw, and sharing in hopes to inspire others. I adopted this lifestyle for health reasons but soon found out about the practices of factory farming and have simply changed my perception about our use of animals, sentient beings they are, for a multitude of things. I LOVE eating a plant based diet and it has grown into what you see here. I started this blog in July of 2012 as a way to share my celebration of foods that are clean, nutrient dense as possible and cruelty free, taking focus off of animal products and processed foods. In essence, I share with you all the simple, beautiful plant foods there are to eat and the different ways to put them together that taste great. Eating a plant based diet has truly become a joy. Vegan food is not boring, complicated or expensive. There is a vast array of foods we can choose everyday that is good for the whole.</p>
