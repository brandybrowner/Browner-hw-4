				<p>It's been two amazing years with my favorite past time…The Simple Veganista! I’ve been sharing whole food plant-based recipes in hopes to inspire others to join me. My first two years of blogging has been an accumulation of many great transitional recipes for those seeking to adopt a vegan lifestyle or just eat better. It is what I ate the first few years of my transition and I still go back time & again to many of them. I wanted to create an easy way for you to always have these timeless, easy vegan recipes at your fingertips without the need of the internet. Plus, I've had many requests for this…so here it is!</p>

				<p>With the thought of the reader in mind, it's formatted as a fully interactive E-Book in PDF format so you can easily navigate & click your way through the epic list of vegan inspiration. It's also designed so you have the ability to print recipes if needed. This publication is compatible with iPad, Android Tablets, most Kindles, Kobo, Sony Readers, Pocket Book, and of course your laptop and desktop computers. Save your copy of this cookbook and use it on any/all of the devices. It's meant to last a lifetime!</p>

				<p>So why do you need to have this book when it's all available here? Well for starters, because it's amazing! It’s a wonderful experience to scroll endlessly through every single recipe at once organized by its category, or simply click from the recipe index and go directly to where you want. I've also organized it in a way that you can get right back to where you were, or very close, in a second. I've created this e-book the way I’d want to use one and think I did a pretty darn good job! Another great reason to have a copy for yourself, if anything was to ever happen (heaven forbid) to this site or you’re simply off-line, you’ll always have a copy of the the Simple Veganista archives on hand wherever you are! I personally have it on my iPad and love it!<p>

				<p>This book is not only full of recipes, but photos as well. I’m a very visual person and you probably are too when it comes to food. It's fun and exciting to scroll through and see some of the recipes you love in a new way and discover some you’ve may have not noticed before. I wanted to keep the price low so anyone can have access to these easy to make, whole food vegan recipes. Priced reasonably and accessibly at $10…it’s an exceptional value!</P>
